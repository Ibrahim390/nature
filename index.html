David Bello said, concerning the writing and production of the record: "When we started writing we were fresh off Trump being elected, so there's an anger to the album that's different from what we've done in the past. There's a lot more resistance thinking throughout the songs – not in a way that's strictly anti-Trump, but also addressing things like white supremacy and controlling elements of the state."[15] The album was released September 29, 2017, to positive reviews.

            Founding member Tom Diaz (born Thomas M. Diaz on September 2, 1986) died unexpectedly on November 1, 2018, at the age of 32.[16][17] On November 3, 2018, the band confirmed his death on their social media accounts.[18]

        <p>Bangladesh is one of the few countries in South Asia, which remains to be explored. Bangladesh has a delicate and distinctive attraction of its own to offer. Bangladesh has a land of enormous beauty, hundreds of serpentine rivers, crystal clear water lakes surrounded by ever green hills, luxuriant tropical rain forests, beautiful cascades of green tea gardens, world's largest mangrove forest preserved as World Heritage, home of the Royal Bengal Tiger and the wild lives, warbling of birds in green trees, wind in the paddy fields, abundance of sunshine, world's longest natural sea beach.

            The country's population is almost evenly distributed throughout its 64 districts except for the three Hill Tracts districts which are rather sparsely inhabited. On average, a district has a population of about 1.8 million, a thana 230,000, a union 25,000 and a village 2,000. There are 4 metropolitan cities and 119 municipalities in the country. The capital city of Dhaka has an estimated population of 8.58 million.</p>

        <p>Kuakata is one of the rarest places which have the unique beauty of offering the full view of the rising and setting of crimson sun in the water of the Bay of Bengal in a calm environment. That perhaps makes Kuakata one of the world's unique beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting.

            Foy's Lake is a man-made lake in Chittagong, Bangladesh. It was dug in 1924 and was named after the Railway engineer Foy. An amusement park Foy's Lake set amidst picturesque surroundings in the railway town-ship of Pahartali 8 km. from Chittagong, this is an ideal spot of outing and picnic thronged by thousands of visitors every week. If someone love the nature this is the place to go.
            
            Mohasthangarh is one of the main attractions in north Bengal. It was the capital of Kingdom of the Mourjo, the Gupta and the Sen Dynasty. This is the ancient archeological and historical which was, established in 2500 BC. It is the oldest archaeological site of Bangladesh.
            
            Overall Bangladesh is a place where someone really can spend a pleasurable and passionate time. Visiting in Bangladesh you will be able to find a lot of friendly people through the tour. People in Bangladesh have a great heart to all, may be the beauty of nature made it possible for all..</p>

        <p>A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE FUTURE
            What the Laws of Biology Tell Us About the Destiny of the Human Species
            By Rob Dunn
            
            Levees surround us. Yes, some hold back rivers that strain against their embankments. But others hold back diseases, which are ready to saturate and overwhelm the fragile walls of antibiotics we’ve erected. And sometimes levees fail. The metaphor extends beyond epidemiology. Nature ceaselessly advances, trespasses, embarrasses our every effort to keep it at bay, and ultimately bursts through. Its rivers will not be contained.
            
            In “A Natural History of the Future,” the ecologist Rob Dunn sketches an arresting vision of this relentless natural world — a world that is in equal measures creative, unguided and extravagant. Fog a tree with pesticides and watch new beetle species tumble from the canopy by the hundreds, a “riot of unnamed life.” Chlorinate your water and, though you might wipe out most parasites, you’ll soon bedew your shower head with chlorine-resistant mycobacteria. Make a world fit for bedbugs, then try to kill them with chemicals, and you’ll end up — not in a world without bedbugs, but one in which they’ve “evolved resistance to half a dozen different pesticides.”.</p>
            
        <p>Fazlun Khalid is Founder of the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences and the author of “Signs on the Earth - Islam Modernity and the Climate Crisis” published in 2019.

            BIRMINGHAM, UK (IDN) — As the post-colonial world emerged in the middle of the last century it left in its wake a host of dismembered traditional societies which for millennia had faith as their anchor and embraced the natural world as the source of life.
            
            The transition to the new world order was in a sense seamless as the ruling powers offloaded their territories creating secular nation-states in their own image. The emerging states were left with institutions defined by the departing powers the most important of which was the central bank whose ability to create money out of thin air sustained the model with debt.
            
            Thus, was created the umbilical cord that tethered each new state to the departing power and ultimately to the evolving global system.
            
            The mid-20th century world was unrecognisable from the world Iberian sailors opened up in the closing years of the 15th century. This period witnessed the unfolding of one of the major episodic events in human history resulting in the emergence of a new paradigm in which faith communities no longer held sway.
            
            It had taken a mere 500 years, a minuscule amount of time measured against the evolution of the human story, to destroy what faith communities and traditional societies had nurtured for millennia.
            
            This left them all adrift and as one thinker pronounced, caused a psychological shift in allegiance in this period from the divine to the human. This process objectified nature to the extent that the sources of life were turned into resources for plunder.
            
            We worry about the decline of biological diversity but it is easy to see now that the root of this was the destruction of the cultural diversity that protected the sources of life, flora and fauna, in their own spaces and in their own time.
            
            This is not to say that past societies were always benevolent towards nature and the fact does remain that when they inevitably collapsed the sands covered their traces and the forests grew over them: they were biodegradable.
            
            But not so the civilisation we live in today. It is conceivable that archaeologists of the future may not only have to contend with ubiquitous plastic and poisonous chemicals but may need to wear radiation suits in order to explore the debris we have left behind.
            
            As we struggle to make sense of the numerous enormities we have foisted on mother Earth, it is becoming evident that they are in fact direct consequences of processes emerging from the evolution of modernity.
            
            As we chase after progress and development, not only are we destroying Earth’s systems but in the process harming ourselves by ingesting toxic chemicals into our bodily systems that did not exist at the time of our grandparents.
            
            This adds up to a new reality - that we now live in a global village viewing existence as a linear continuum of economic progress going right against the grain of the natural world.
            
            Geologists have proposed that we now live in the Anthropocene - the age of the human reflecting the fact that we are now a force of nature. It is suggested by some that this epoch began in the mid- 20th century with the emergence of nuclear energy, disposable plastics and the human population boom.
            
            Others point their fingers at the industrial revolution. In my view however, it began with the creation of the Bank of England in 1694. It institutionalized the processes of creating money out of thin air and lending it for a fee (usury/interest) a practice that is strictly forbidden in Islamic teachings.
            
            This provides the convenient illusion that there is more wealth to be had than actually exists in the natural world, a proposition reducing the money we use today to the nature of a virus. This is called “Capitalism” projecting the idea of abundance for all seen by many as a serious diversion from reality.
            
            The Global footprint network informs us that “Earth Overshoot Day” 2021 fell on July 29. We are thus living in borrowed time and for the rest of 2021 will be helping ourselves to the depleting stocks of Earth’s resources, the lions share being sucked up by the richest countries of the world.
            
            This reminds us quite clearly what the Club of Rome demonstrated to us in limits to growth way back in 1972. Looked at from this perspective sustainable development needs to be rethought because in order for the less well-off to meet their needs without a consequent negative impact on Earth systems, those who already have more than enough should accept considerably less. There is some balancing to be done here which is to remind the well-off of their obligations so policy makers please note. Or is Wall Street too hot to handle?
            
            Predictably there were serious divisions in the COP 26 process which recently concluded in Glasgow. The term "game changer" on the one hand was used by a politician to proclaim success and on the other by a scientist to pronounce failure.
            
            Whilst numerous NGOs and FBOs (Faith Based Organisations) were demonstrating palpable enthusiasm for change the oil lobby and big business kept quietly working away at the delegates to keep things as they are.
            
            The picture this conjures up in my mind is that of an ever enlarging hole being dug out by huge bulldozers driven by the banks and big business whilst a host of people try to fill it up with little buckets.
            
            Traditional and indigenous communities lived in a manner that was integral to nature and in the absence of scripture the natural world itself was the text. Eastern traditions also had a close affinity with nature, and it was looked upon as a gift from the Creator by all three Abrahamic faiths. All spiritual traditions teach us mindfulness, caring and sharing.
            
            However, in today's world greed has been institutionalised and it is now known as consumerism. Our rituals are incomplete without going shopping. We are now seamlessly becoming green consumers, hooked into social media and trapped by the mobile phone heralding the consolidation of techno civilisation much to the delight of big business.
            
            This is where we hit the buffers of biodiversity. Where will we continue to find the rare earth, the cobalt and the lithium that are going to give us high efficiency batteries that will drive our civilisation? And where are we going to dump these batteries by the ton when they are exhausted?</p>
